History and bug fixes of KaKs_Calculator
Please send bugs or advice to Zhang Zhang at zhangzhang@genomics.org.cn.


Version 1.2,  April 2006
Three methods are incorporated into the program of KaKs_Calculator:
  
  1. MYN: modified YN, with a consideraton of different transitional rates, that is, MYN is based on the TN93 Model.

  2. MS: Model-selected method according to the AICc, based on 14 candidate models.

  3. MA: Model-averaged method according to the AICc, based on 14 candidate models.


Modifications and Bug fixes:

  1. Add more genetic codes and accordingly modify Li's series methods for calculating 0,2,4-fold.

  2. For windows version, implement multi-thread by generating a working thread.

  3. Modify the output format.

  4. Add the function for computing GC Content of entire sequences and of three different codon positions.



Version 1.0,  October 2005
Three programs are included in the package:

  1. KaKs_Calculator: Use NG, LWL, LPB, MLWL, MLPB, GY and YN for estimating Ka and Ks.

  2. ConPairs: Concatenate all pairs of sequences with AXT format to a pair of sequences.

  3. AXTConvertor: Convert Clustal/Msf/Nexus/Phylip/Pir format sequences to AXT ones.
