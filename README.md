Description
-----
Small proteins shorter than 50 amino acids have been long overlooked. Dozens of small proteins have been identified in model bacteria using experimental approaches and assigned important functions in diverse cellular processes. While genome-wide identification of small proteins has become feasible due to the recent development of ribosome profiling technologies, our incomplete understanding of small proteins and small ORFs (smORFs) hinders de novo computational prediction of smORFs in non-model bacterial species.
